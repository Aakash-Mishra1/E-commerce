    "1.  **Product Search, Filters, and Sorting**: Currently the Home page is static.\n",
    "    -   *Action*: Update `Home.jsx` to add a Search Bar, Category Filter, and Price Sorter. Implement the logic to filter the mock product list.\n",
    "2.  **Admin Dashboard Analytics**: Currently a placeholder.\n",
    "    -   *Action*: Update `AdminDashboard.jsx` to show \"Analytics\" cards (Total Sales, Orders, Users) to satisfy the \"powerful dashboard\" requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Update Home.jsx\n",
    "-   Add state: `searchTerm`, `category`, `sortType`.\n",
    "-   Add Mock Categories: Electronics, Fashion, etc.\n",
    "-   Implement filtering logic.\n",
    "-   Add UI controls for these filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Update AdminDashboard.jsx\n",
    "-   Add an \"Overview\" tab (default) or \"Analytics\" tab content.\n",
    "-   Create Bootstrap Cards for \"Total Revenue\", \"Total Orders\", \"Active Users\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Verify Navbar\n",
    "-   Ensure logical navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will proceed with updating `Home.jsx` first."
